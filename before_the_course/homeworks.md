# Homeworks
## For the first day
Install necessary [programs](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2019-Stylometry/blob/master/installations.md), let us know if you encounter problems that you cannot fix - you will find the list of common issues [here]. 

## For the second day
Prepare your corpus: about 20-30 texts of approximately similar length, saved in plain text (txt) format, UTF-8 encoded (if you're using Windows machine, please check that the files are saved as UTF-8 without BOM - you can easily do that with one of the text editors we recommended in [useful tools](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2019-Stylometry/blob/master/before_the_course/useful_tools.md). One source of texts you may want to choose is [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/). You can also choose of the corpora offered in our group's [resources](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/resources/).

## For the (probably) fourth day
Think about an authorship case study you'd like to do tomorrow. We'll be learning classify() and rolling.classify(), which are methods for examining influences on the author in detail. While we'll be able to provide you with data for experiments, you now know it's even more fun if you do your own thing.  
You will need:  
* 1 (or more) text you want to examine. It can be an anonymous work or a suspected collaborative work,
* collection of texts by at least 2 potential authors,
  * note that the number of words for each of them should be roughly equal, so e.g. 5 texts of 10,000 words each for each of the authors is fine, but 5 of 10,000 i 10 of 100 - not.
