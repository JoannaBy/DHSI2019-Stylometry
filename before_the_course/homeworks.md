## For the first class
Install necessary programs, let us know if you encounter problems. 

## For the second class
Prepare your corpus (about 20-30 texts of approx. similar length, saved in plain text (txt) format, UTF-8 encoded. One source of texts you may want to choose is [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).  

## For the (probably) fourth class

Think about an authorship case study you'd like to do tomorrow. We'll be learning classify() and rolling.classify(), which are methods for examining influences on the author in detail. While we'll be able to provide you with data for experiments, you now know it's even more fun if you do your own thing.  
You will need:  
* 1 (or more) text you want to examine. It can be an anonymous work or a suspected collaborative work,
* collection of texts by at least 2 potential authors,
  * note that the number of words for each of them should be roughly equal, so e.g. 5 texts of 10,000 words each for each of the authors is fine, but 5 of 10,000 i 10 of 100 - not.
