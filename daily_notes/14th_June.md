# 15th June
This file includes notes and materials for the fifth day of the course and will grow during the day.
## What we cover today
### Introduction to stylometry
* Modularity algorithm
  * Is one of *community detection* algorithms.
  * Modularity has a high value when many more edges in a network fall between vertices of the same type then one would expect by chance,
  * Good divisions of the network into communities are those that have high values of the corresponding modularity.

* Community detection:
  * the search for the naturally occurring groups in a network regardless of their number or size,
  * used primarily as a tool for discovering and understanding the large-scale structure of networks.
  * separates network into groups of vertices that have few connections between them.
* Writing simple R scripts
