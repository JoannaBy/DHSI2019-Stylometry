# 11th June

This file includes notes and materials for the first day of the course and will grow during the day.

### Introduction to stylometry:
Today we cover [plan and outline]
* how does stylometry work?
* why do the most frequent words matter,
* the concept of Delta distance measure,
* cluster analysis - simple classification supervised machine learning method,
* bootstrap consensus tree (more on that tomorrow!)

### Today we covered - details:
* history of stylometry (early cases of debate over authorshop of The Donation of Constantine, works of Shakespeare, Pauline Epistles and Plato),
* what kind of texts do we need for the analysis? "Raw" texts usually provide enough information for a successful authorship attribution,
* applications of stylometry: authorship attribution, genre studies, chronology studies.
