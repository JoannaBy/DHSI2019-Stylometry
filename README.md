Notes and materials for "Stylometry with R: Computer-Assisted Analysis of Literary Texts" course run by [Maciej Eder](http://maciejeder.org/), [Joanna Byszuk](https://joannaby.github.io/) and Artjoms Šeļa at the [DHSI 2021](http://www.dhsi.org).

We acknowledge and respect the Lkwungen-speaking peoples, on whose traditional territory the university where we teach stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

### Reading  
10
All the suggested readings are available in the coursepack provided to you via DHSI channels.  
11
We also created a [syllabus of references used in the coursepack and suggested further reading](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2021-Stylometry/blob/master/before_the_course/reading.md) (note that the latter list might grow to reflect our discussions during the course).

### Useful links and homework
17
While you are not obliged to do this before the course, you might find it useful to take a look [here](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2021-Stylometry/blob/master/before_the_course/useful_tools.md) and think about your text editor and other tools you use. Finally, take a look at [the homeworks](https://github.com/JoannaBy/DHSI2021-Stylometry/blob/master/before_the_course/homeworks.md) we will be dealing with - perhaps you'd like to get a head start and have more time to relax in the evenings during the course?

The following files will be changing to best reflect the interest of the group (and to document what we do together). The proposed schedule is a very rough version based on our past experiences teaching this course.
